Contents
: Document all important design decisions and their reasons!

Motivation
: It is advantageous if all important design decisions can be found in one place. It is up to you to decide if a decision should be documented here or rather locally (e.g. in the white box descriptions of building blocks). In any case avoid redundancies.

Form
: Informal list, if possible ordered by the decisions’ importance for the reader. Use the following template to structure your decisions.
